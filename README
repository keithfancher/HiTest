HITEST
======

Generates unit test boilerplate for Python modules.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
* python
* argparse (standard with Python 2.7+)


USAGE
-----
Just call it with your module as a command line argument. Output goes to
stdout. For example, to generate test boilerplate for wacky_module.py:

    $ ./hitest.py wacky_module.py > test_wacky_module.py

Then fill in your tests and pat yourself on the back for being a Good
Programmer!


A NOTE ON PATHS
---------------
The generated tests will always import your module directly, ignoring any
containing package or path. For instance, if you were to call it thusly:

    $ ./hitest.py big_package/impressive_module.py

The generated test will import your module like this:

    import impressive_module

NOT like this:
    
    import big_package.impressive_module

Everyone has different preferences and conventions about where they keep their
unit tests. Rather than try to guess what your preference is, I simply assume
that your tests will live in the same directory as your tested modules. If
that's not the case, just modify the import statement and you're good to go!
